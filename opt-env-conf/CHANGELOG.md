# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

* `xdgYamlConfigFile` now returns a `Path Abs File` instead of a `FilePath`.
* Fixed a bug in `withFirstYamlConfig` and `withCombinedYamlConfig` in which the `--config-file` option was required.
* `--run-settings-check` now allows you to define a static settings check.
