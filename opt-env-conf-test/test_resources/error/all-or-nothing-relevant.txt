You are seeing this error because at least one, but not all, of the settings in an allOrNothing (or subSettings) parser have been defined.
The following settings have been parsed:
[36mtest/OptEnvConf/ErrorSpec.hs:153:21 in main:OptEnvConf.ErrorSpec[m
Hit the 'empty' case of the Parser type, this should not happen.
